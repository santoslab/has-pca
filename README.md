# K-State High Assurance System - PCA Pump

**Installation Instructions**

* Step 1: Install OSATE
  
  Follow the [download and installation](http://osate.org/download-and-install.html#) 
  instructions from the OSATE website.  However, rather than installing 
  the latest version of OSATE (i.e. v2.2.3), install 
  [v2.2.2](http://aadl.info/aadl/osate/stable/2.2.2/products/) instead.
  
* Step 2: Launch OSATE and import the PCA-Pump project from GitHub

  Goto ``File >> Import`` and select ``Git >> Projects from Git``.
  
  Choose ``Clone URI`` and paste the following URI into the URI field:
  ``https://github.com/santoslab/has-pca.git``
  
  You can continue clicking the Next button to accept the default import
  options.  Click the Finish button once it is enabled.
